v0.0.4
  * Corrected a problem with the `PUT` method sending an Accept: header
    incorrectly. Puppet has gotten more correct in its validation.
  * This allows fingerpuppet to properly submit a CRS again.

v0.0.3
  * Add more documentation
  * Properly authenticate the sign request
  * Release a Puppet module to manage auth.conf and fingerpuppet.
    (This is a giant hack and should never be used.)

v0.0.2
  * Released gem

v0.0.1
  * Initial release
